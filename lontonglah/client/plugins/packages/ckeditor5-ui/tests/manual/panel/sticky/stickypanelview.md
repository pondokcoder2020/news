## Vertical scrolling

### Sticky to the top of the viewport

1. When the page is scrolled vertically, the panel should
	1. stick to the top of the viewport first,
	1. then disappear beyond the upper edge of the viewport as it touches the red area
	1. but never cover the red area or go beyond the upper edge of editor mock–up.

### Sticky to the green box

1. When the page is scrolled vertically, the panel should
	1. stick to the bottom of the green box first,
	1. then disappear beyond the bottom edge of the green box as it touches the red area
	1. but never cover the red area or go beyond the upper edge of editor mock–up.

## Horizontal scrolling

1. The panel should always fit horizontally within the editor mock–up, regardless of the position of the h– and v–scrolls of the web page.

## On–load positioning

1. Scroll the web page vertically and horizontally, so the panel is sticky.
1. Reload the web page.
1. The panel should get sticky as the page reloads, if the position of scrollbars and the geometry of the viewport creates such a need.
