### Loading

The data should be loaded with:
- 7 paragraphs with font sizes (10, 12, 14, default, 18, 20, 22),

### Testing

Try to:
- Change font by selecting many paragraphs.
- Change font by selecting some text.
- Change to default font by selecting many paragraphs.

### Converters mode

The "Restricted value matching" option means that all font-size values that aren't defined in the plugin's configuration will be removed (e.g. when pasted from Google Docs).
This behaviour can be disabled by selecting the "Disabled value matching" option.

All font-size above 22 aren't specified in the plugin's configuration and should be restored to default size when the "Restricted value matching" option is selected.

By default editor should load with the "Disabled value matching" option.
