<div id="snippet-image-style-custom">
	<p>This is a default image (no style):</p>

	<figure class="image">
		<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/fields.jpg" alt="Autumn fields">
	</figure>

	<p>This is a right-aligned image, resized to 50% width:</p>

	<figure class="image image-style-align-right" style="width: 50%;">
		<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/fields.jpg" alt="Autumn fields">
	</figure>

	<p>Yet another sample paragraph and lots of text here, again. Quite a lot of text, just like before. And this huge amount of text forms a whole long paragraph. This whole lot of text is here to help you see the image's alignment in context. It serves no other purpose, though. But we still find it useful and plain like it. And it is even longer than the previous one. Go on an use the image style buttons to make the most out of this pretty text block and the image alignment demo.</p>
