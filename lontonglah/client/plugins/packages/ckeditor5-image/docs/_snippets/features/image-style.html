	<p>This is a full-width image (default style):</p>

	<figure class="image">
		<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/fields.jpg" alt="Autumn fields">

	<p>This is a side image:</p>

	<figure class="image image-style-side">
		<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/fields.jpg" alt="Autumn fields">
	</figure>

	<p>Lots of text here. Quite a lot of text, indeed. In fact, there is plenty of text beside this image and it forms a whole long paragraph. This whole lot of text is here to help you see the image's alignment in context. It serves no other purpose, though. But we still find it useful and plain like it.</p>
