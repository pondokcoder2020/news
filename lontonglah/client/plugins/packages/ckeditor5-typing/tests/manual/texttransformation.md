## Text transformation

The list of default transformations is available in the docs.

Some of the transformations are:

1. Symbols:

    * Copyright: `(c)` to `¬©`.
    * Registered treademark: `(r)` to `¬Æ`.
    * Trade mark: `(tm)` to `‚Ñ¢.`

1. Mathematical:

    * Fractions of 2, 3 & 4, like `¬Ω` to `¬Ω` or `3/4` to `¬æ`. (ps.: there's no `2/4` üòâ)
    * Arrows: `->`, `<-`.
    * Operators: `<=` to `‚â§`, `>=` to `‚â•`, `!=` to `‚â†`.

1. Typography:

    * Dashes: ` -- `, ` --- `.
    * Ellipsis: `...` to `‚Ä¶`

1. Quotes:

    * Primary quotes (english): `'Foo bar'` to `‚ÄòFoo bar‚Äô`
    * Secondary quotes (english): `"Foo bar's"` to `‚ÄúFoo bar's‚Äù`

### Testing

* Check if the transformation works. Note that some might need a space to trigger (dashes).
* Undo a text transformation and type - it should not re-transform it.
* Change selection - the not transformed elements should stay.
