### The toolbar should support a vertical offset from the top of the web page [#60](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/issues/60)

## Focus then scroll

1. Focus the editor.
2. Scroll the web page until the toolbar reaches the green box boundaries.

**Expected:**

1. The toolbar should stick to the green box instead of the viewport edge, respecting `toolbar.viewportTopOffset` configuration.
2. At some point, the toolbar should disappear below the green box, leaving some space for the last paragraph of the content to remain visible.

## Scroll then focus

1. Scroll the web page until the toolbar is underneath the green box.
2. Focus the editor.

**Expected:**

1. The toolbar should stick to the lower boundary of the green box.
