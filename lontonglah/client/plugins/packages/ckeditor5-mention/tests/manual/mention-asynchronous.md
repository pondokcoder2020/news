## Mention asynchronous feeds

### Configuration

The feed is asynchronous list that is loaded from server (`@` marker) after random delay:

- 60% of requests completes in 150ms.
- 40% of requests completes in 400ms, 1s, 2s or 4s.

In order to run the server go to the `tests/_utils/asyncserver/` and run:

```sh
node index.js
```  

### Interaction

Controlling the cache:

- You can enable caching mechanism of the tests `getFeed()` callback - if checked it will save results and load them from cache for the same query.
- If cache is disabled then no loading nor saving will be performed.

### Behavior

There should be no errors even if request took longer time or came out-of-order.

If the asyncserver is not running the notification should be shown for failed requests.
