	<h2>About CKEditor&nbsp;5, v0.3.0</h2>

	<p>This is the <a href="http://ckeditor.com/blog/Third-Developer-Preview-of-CKEditor-5-Available">third developer preview</a> of <a href="https://ckeditor.com">CKEditor&nbsp;5</a>.</p>

	<p>After 2 years of work, building the next generation editor from scratch and closing over 670 tickets, we created a highly <strong>extensible and flexible architecture</strong> which consists of an <strong>amazing editing framework</strong> and <strong>editing solutions</strong> that will be built on top of it.</p>

	<h3>Notes</h3>

	<p><a href="https://ckeditor.com">CKEditor&nbsp;5</a> is <i>under heavy development</i> and this demo is not production-ready software. For example:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>only Chrome, Opera and Safari are supported</strong>,</li>
		<li>Firefox requires enabling the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/onselectionchange">&ldquo;dom.select_events.enabled&rdquo;</a> option,</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/342">support for pasting</a> is under development.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It has <em>bugs</em> that we are aware of – and that we will be working on in the next few iterations of the project. Stay tuned for some updates soon!</p>
