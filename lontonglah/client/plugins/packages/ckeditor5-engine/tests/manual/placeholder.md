### Placeholder creation

* You should see two placeholders:
  * for heading: `Type some header text...`,
  * and for paragraph: `Type some paragraph text...`.
* Clicking on header and paragraph should remove placeholder.
* Clicking outside the editor should show both placeholders.
* Type some text into paragraph, and click outside. Paragraph placeholder should be hidden.
* Remove added text and click outside - paragraph placeholder should now be visible again.
