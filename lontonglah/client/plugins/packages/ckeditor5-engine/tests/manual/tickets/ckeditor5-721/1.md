## Renderer should handle nested editables [FF] <a href="https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/721">ckeditor5#721</a>

### TC1

1. Put the caret in the first paragraph and type something.
1. Put the caret inside the widget (in "bar").
1. Click "Undo" or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> (check both).

**Expected**:

No error in the console.

### TC2

Try the same TC as above but use both nested editables. See if the focus is correctly moved between them.
