## Renderer - infinite `selectionChange` event

Place the selection like this:

```
This is {an <strong>editor}</strong> instance.
```

(it must end at the end of the inline style)

**Expected**:

* Every time selection is changed, console log with `selectionChange` is printed once.
* While creating selection from **2.**, there might be `renderer-selection-similar` warning visible in the console.
