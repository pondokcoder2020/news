### Auto-linking manual test [#475](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/issues/475)

 - put the caret at the end of the line,
 - type the link (http://cksource.com).

Expected result: link should appear where you typed it. It should change the `src` property as you type.

Note: this is not a full feature, some other cases may not work.
