## Renderer - MacOS accent balloon on inline element boundary

1. Place the selection like this:

   `This is an <strong>editor{}</strong> instance.`
2. Open MacOS accent balloon (e.g. long `a` press).
3. Navigate through the balloon panel using arrow keys.

**Expected**: It is possible to navigate with arrow keys inside the MacOS balloon panel. While navigating, there
might be `renderer-selection-similar` warning visible in the console.
